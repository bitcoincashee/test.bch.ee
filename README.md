# bch.ee Parasite Pool — Testnet4

**This is the Testnet4 version of [bch.ee](https://github.com/bitcoincashee/bch.ee).**

A Bitcoin Cash (BCH) mining pool with a 1 BCH block finder bonus, Full Round Payouts (PROP), and a ~0.7% effective fee.

Run by the developer of [SoloChance.org](https://solochance.org). Inspired by [parasite.space](https://parasite.space).

## Connect

| Setting  | Value                     |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Stratum  | `testnet4.bch.ee:3333`    |
| Username | `YOUR_BCH_ADDRESS.worker` |
| Password | `x`                       |

For high-diff rentals (e.g. NiceHash), use port `3334`.

No registration required — your BCH address is your identity.

## Payout Structure

1. **1 BCH** finder bonus to whoever finds the block (fee-free), paid directly in the block's coinbase
2. **99%** of the remaining reward (Block Reward + Tx Fees - 1 BCH) split proportionally (PROP) among all miners by shares, also paid in the coinbase — no minimum, even 1 sat is paid
3. **1%** pool fee on the remaining reward

All shares since the last block count equally — no luck penalty. Every payout is included directly in the coinbase transaction that finds the block, so it's fully trustless with no ongoing bookkeeping.

## Fee

The effective fee on the full block reward is approximately **~0.7%** because the 1 BCH finder bonus is paid fee-free. The 1% fee applies only to the remaining distributable reward.
